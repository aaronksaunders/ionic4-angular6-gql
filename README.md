# ionic4-angular6-gql
updated ionic graphql project - still work in progress, this will be based off of this older Ionic GraphQL project [ionic2-graphql-apollo-client](https://github.com/aaronksaunders/ionic2-graphql-apollo-client)


## Using the latest version of ionic framework

## Apollo LaunchPad

The server for this project is located here

- https://launchpad.graphql.com/r9x8jkr0qn

> Launchpad is an in-browser GraphQL server playground. You can write a GraphQL schema example in JavaScript, and instantly create a serverless, publicly-accessible GraphQL endpoint. We call these code snippets that live on Launchpad “pads”.
